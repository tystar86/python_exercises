>Write a Python script that takes input from the user and displays that input back in upper and lower cases.

#14. 
>Write a Python program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input and prints the unique words in sorted form (alphanumerically).

**Example**
```
Sample Words : red, white, black, red, green, black
Expected Result : black, green, red, white,red
```

#15. 
>Write a Python function to create the HTML string with tags around the word(s).

**Example**
```
Sample function and result : 
add_tags('i', 'Python') -> '<i>Python</i>'
add_tags('b', 'Python Tutorial') -> '<b>Python Tutorial </b>'
```

#16. 
>Write a Python function to insert a string in the middle of a string.

**Example**
```
Sample function and result : 
insert_sting_middle('[[]]<<>>', 'Python') -> [[Python]]
insert_sting_middle('{{}}', 'PHP') -> {{PHP}}
```

#17. 
>Write a Python function to get a string made of 4 copies of the last two characters of a specified string (length must be at least 2).

**Example**
```
Sample function and result : 
insert_end('Python') -> onononon
insert_end('Exercises') -> eseseses
```

#18. 
>Write a Python function to get a string made of its first three characters of a specified string. If the length of the string is less than 3 then return the original string.

**Example**
```
Sample function and result : 
first_three('ipy') -> ipy
first_three('python') -> pyt
```

#19. 
>Write a Python program to get the last part of a string before a specified character.

#20. 
>Write a Python function to reverses a string if it's length is a multiple of 4.

#21. 
>Write a Python function to convert a given string to all uppercase if it contains at least 2 uppercase characters in the first 4 characters.

#22.
>Write a Python program to sort a string lexicographically.

#23. 
>Write a Python program to remove a newline in Python.

#24. 
>Write a Python program to check whether a string starts with specified characters.

#25. 
>Write a Python program to create a Caesar encryption.

**Note:**
* In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.
